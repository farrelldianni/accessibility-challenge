# Accesibility Within The Hariseon Social Solution Services Site
---
## Description

- This project was about taking an exsisting site, with already working code, and making it easier for people who use accesibility tools.

- Another facet of this project was to clean up and get rid of redundant code. Redundant class calls, slimming down of the amount of classes, as well as formatting the code itself to be more easily read
